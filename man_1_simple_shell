.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]hs\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]hsh\f[] is a simple command interpreter for the system
.SS Overview
.PP
This shell is a command that reads lines from the terminal, interprets
them, and generally executes other commands
.SS Invocation
.PP
The shell can be executed in two ways: Interactive and Non\-Interactive
mode
.SS Interactive mode
.PP
If The shell isn't executed in a pipe, it will interpret commands in
interactive mode, reading and executing lines fed to it until an EOF is
sent on an empty line.
.SS Non\-Interactive mode
.PP
If the shell is piped, it will read and try to execute all commands sent
to it and then stop.
.SS Lexical Structure
.PP
The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up
into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain sequences of
characters that are special to the shell called \[lq]operators\[rq].
This shell only handles newlines and `;' operators
.SS Path search
.PP
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell
function by that name.
Then it looks for a builtin command by that name.
If no builtin was found it then searches for the command in the PATH
environment variable if the command isn't preceded by a `/' character.
